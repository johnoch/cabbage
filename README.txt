Cabbage is a software for prototyping and developing audio plugins with the Csound audio synthesis language. It provides Csound programmers with a simple albeit powerful toolkit for the development of cross-platform audio software. Cabbage is released under a modified GPL license which means you must include all Cabbage source, as well as the relevant Csound files with any Cabbage instrument you distribute commercially.
